# 🔍 NakedPolicy

**Privacy Policies. Terms. Cookies. Simplified.**

NakedPolicy is an intelligent browser extension that breaks down complex legal documents — privacy policies, terms & conditions, cookie notices, and codes of conduct — into simple, human-friendly summaries.

Modern digital platforms bury users under pages of legal jargon. **NakedPolicy cuts through the noise and gives you instant clarity**, one line at a time.

## 🚨 The Problem It Solves

Every day, millions of users blindly click "Accept" without understanding what they're agreeing to. Privacy policies and terms are intentionally:

- **Long** — Often 10,000+ words
- **Confusing** — Written in dense legal language
- **Packed with jargon** — Technical and legal terms everywhere

Because of this, users rarely know:

❌ What personal data is collected  
❌ How it's used or shared  
❌ How long it's stored  
❌ What rights they actually have  
❌ What cookies and trackers are running in the background  

**This lack of transparency puts people at risk** of unwanted tracking, data misuse, and unfair terms.

pip install --upgrade google-genai flask flask-cors playwright
playwright install chromium
```
